I built this application in my final year of college to help secondary school students with their math homework. It is an online calculator that can solve equations and display a full step-by-step guide on how the equation was solved. This can be an incredibly useful tool when practicing a new equation, because it gives the student instant feedback. Whereas in the past they would have had to wait until their teacher had corrected their homework, which could take days.

Technologies Used:

 - PHP and the Laravel Framework for the backend
 - AngularJS for the fronted
 - Sass and Bourbon Mixins for the design
 - Sketch for the initial wireframes and designs
