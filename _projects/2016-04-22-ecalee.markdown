I built this application in my final year of college to help secondary school students with their math homework. It is an online calculator that can solve equations and display a full step-by-step guide on how the equation was solved. This can be an incredibly useful tool when practicing a new equation, because it gives the student instant feedback. Whereas in the past they would have had to wait until their teacher had corrected their homework, which could take days.
