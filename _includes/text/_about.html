Hey, I’m Sam and I’m a Full Stack Developer / UX Designer.
<br>
<br>
I build web applications that cover everything from crawling
online marketplaces to gather marketing data, to completing a student’s math homework.
<br>
<br>
I share most of my project’s code on GitHub along
with detailed step by step case studies to follow along with.
<br>
<br>
All of which can be found just below on this page in the Portfolio Section.
So feel free to check them out!
