I am a Full Stack Developer / User Experience Designer.

<br>
I design and build web applications that automate tasks such as crawling
online marketplaces to gather marketing data, to completing a student’s

I share most of my project’s code on GitHub along with
detailed step by step case studies to follow along with.
